# Overview
The [Stretch Firmware](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_firmware) repository provides the Arduino based firmware for the Stretch robot. 

Minor version updates to Stretch Body may occasionally require the robot's firmware to also be updated.

The repository includes the firmware for the three Stretch PCBA types: 

* hello_stepper: firmware for stepper motor controller based on the Mechaduino project
* hello_wacc: firmware for wrist accelerometer board (Wacc) in the wrist 
* hello_pimu:  firmware for power and imu board (Pimu) in the base
